#Rap Battle RPG
When the game starts, the user will input a name and hometown. The user raps against other rappers to gain money. The user will be able to fight other rappers by spitting bars in a rap battle. The more 'fire' the bars are, the more damage will be inflicted upon the opposing rapper. By winning rap battles, the user gains money to purchase upgrades to increase their health, defense, and attack stats. As you win more rap battles, the enemy rappers deal more damage. In order to win the game, the user must win a certain amount of battles to buy a record deal.
