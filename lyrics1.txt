[Intro] This is called being high as shit, for hours That's the name of this song, nigga "High as Shit for Hours" Here we go, yeah [Verse 1] American hypocrisy, oh, let me count the ways They came here seekin' freedom Then they end up ownin' slaves Justified it usin' Christianity which saves Religion don't mean shit, there's too much ego in the way That's why ISIS is a crisis But in reality this country do the same shit Take a life and call it righteous Remember when Bin Laden got killed, supposedly? In a hotel lobby after a show, was noticin' These white ladies watchin' CNN, coverin' the action They read the headline and then they all started clappin' As if LeBron had just scored a basket at the buzzer I stood there for a second, watched them high-five each other For real? I thought this was "Thou shalt not kill" But police still lettin' off on niggas in the Ville Claimin' that he reached for a gun They really think we dumb and got a death wish Now somebody's son is layin' breathless When I was a little boy my father lived in Texas Pulled up in Toyota, drove that bitch like it was Lexus Put my bag in his trunk and headed off for Dallas Out there for the summer, feelin' just like I was Alice Lost in the Wonderland where niggas still sufferin' Just like they was back home, and that's wrong So now it's "Fuck the government!" They see my niggas strugglin' And they don't give a fuck at all, and that's wrong, yeah [Hook] The type of shit that make you wanna The type of shit that make you wanna let go The type of shit that make you wanna The type of shit that make you wanna let go [Verse 2] I had a convo with the President, I paid to go and see him Thinkin' about the things I said I'd say when I would see him Feelin' nervous, sittin' in a room full of white folks Thinkin' about the black man plight, think I might choke Nope, raised my hand and asked a man a question Does he see the struggle of his brothers in oppression? And if so, if you got all the power in the clout As the President, what's keepin' you from helpin' niggas out? Well, I didn't say "nigga," but you catch my drift He looked me in my eyes and spoke and he was rather swift He broke the issues down and showed me he was well-aware I got the vibe he was sincere and that the brother cared But dawg, you in the chair, what's the hold up? He said, "There's things that I wanna fix But you know this shit, nigga: politics." Don't stop fightin' and don't stop believin' You can make the world better for your kids before you leave it Change is slow, always has been, always will be But fuck that, I'ma bust back 'til they kill me Change is slow, always has been, always will be But fuck that, I'ma bust back until they kill me—feel me? [Hook] The type of shit that make you wanna (Aight, third verse) The type of shit that make you wanna let go The type of shit that make you wanna The type of shit that make you wanna let go [Verse 3] Here's a thought for my revolutionary heart Take a deeper look at history, it's there to pick apart See, the people at the top, they get to do just what they want 'Til after a while the people at the bottom finally get smart Then they start to holla "Revolution!" Tired of livin' here, destitution Fuck that lootin'! Can you tell me what's the best solution? I used to think it was to overthrow oppressors, see If we destroy the system, that means we'll have less of greed But see, it's not that simple I got to thinkin' about the history of human nature While this instrumental played Then I realized somethin' that made Me wonder if revolution was really ever the way Before you trip and throw a fit over these words I say Think about this shit for a second, you heard the way The children in abusive households grow up Knockin' girlfriends out cold—that's called a cycle Abused becomes the abuser and that's just how life go So understand You get the power, but you know what power does to man?
